# Spoon & Sketch — MVP Implementation Plan

> **For any Claude instance picking this up:** Read this entire file before touching code.
> Every architectural decision here was made deliberately. The "why" is documented inline.
> The north-star test is at the bottom of this file — run it mentally before marking any phase done.

## 📁 Companion documents — read these too

This file is the master plan. The documents below expand on specific concerns.
**Do not duplicate their content here — reference them.**

| File | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `SCREENS.md` | Screen-by-screen UX specs: UI elements, user actions, empty/error states, microcopy, navigation pattern. Critical path (7 screens) fully specced. |
| `USER_FLOW.md` | Full end-to-end user journeys: first-time, onboarding, login, main task loop, Telegram, notifications, paywall, Cook Mode. Drop-off risks + analytics events list. |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Client-side production architecture: folder structure, state management (TanStack Query + Zustand split), navigation setup, API layer, auth handling, local storage tiers, env config, error handling (3 layers), analytics hooks (PostHog), testing structure (unit + integration + Maestro E2E). |
| `BACKEND.md` | Full backend plan: production-ready SQL schema with RLS + triggers, all Edge Function implementations (extract-recipe, auto-sticker, generate-pdf, lulu-webhook, revenuecat-webhook, telegram-auth), file upload strategy, push notification flow, subscription logic, Telegram bot code, admin panel, security rules, hosting scale path. |

> **If PLAN.md and a companion file disagree, the companion file is more recent and correct.**
> The database schema in `BACKEND.md` supersedes the schema section below (it adds triggers, counters, RLS policies, full indexes, and corrected column names).
> The folder structure in `ARCHITECTURE.md` supersedes the file structure section below (it is more granular and accurate).

## What this app is

**Spoon & Sketch** is a cozy scrapbook cookbook app for millennials who want a beautiful,
printable family cookbook but can't draw. The primary use case is a **gift** — you make a
decorated cookbook and either print it at home or order a physical bound copy shipped
directly to the recipient.

Two layers to every recipe:
- **Structured data layer** — ingredients, steps, times, tags (practical, cookable from)
- **Scrapbook decoration layer** — stickers, washi tape, photos, handwriting, drawings (beautiful, giftable)

The product is emotional. A physical cookbook you made yourself, with a handwritten
dedication page, is irreplaceable. That is the core value proposition.

---

## Core features

These are the features that define the product. Without any one of them, the app is not Spoon & Sketch.

- **Recipe management** — create, edit, import (manual / URL / screenshot), organise into cookbooks and collections
- **Scrapbook canvas editor** — place stickers, washi tape, text, photos on a recipe page; move, rotate, scale each element
- **Freehand drawing** — draw on any canvas page with finger or Apple Pencil; variable stroke width, opacity, blend modes, multiple layers
- **"Make me Sketch"** — one-tap AI auto-decoration: Claude Haiku reads the recipe and places relevant stickers automatically
- **Recipe import via Telegram bot** — send a link or screenshot to the bot, recipe appears in the app within 30 seconds
- **In-app recipe import** — paste a URL or upload a screenshot directly inside the app (same AI pipeline as bot)
- **Book builder** — assemble a full book: cover, dedication, about, chapter dividers, recipe pages, TOC, closing page
- **Handwritten dedication** — write a personal message with Apple Pencil (or mouse/touch) on the dedication page
- **PDF export** — generate a full-book PDF in Scrapbook style (decorated) or Clean style (minimal)
- **Print-on-demand** — order a physical bound book via Lulu xPress, shipped to any address
- **Cook Mode** — step-by-step cooking view with screen-on, progress indicators, and per-step ingredient checklist
- **4 palette themes** — Terracotta, Sage, Blush, Cobalt — applied app-wide, user-selectable
- **English + Ukrainian** — full UI localisation, Haiku responds in user's language

---

## Nice-to-have features

Real features worth building — but only after the core loop is validated.

| Feature | Why it waits |
|---|---|
| Android support | Validate on iOS + Web first; Expo makes the port straightforward once stable |
| Family / co-editing cookbooks | Adds real-time conflict resolution; complex for v1 |
| Template marketplace | Designers sell page templates; needs moderation + payment split |
| User-submitted sticker packs | Needs moderation pipeline |
| Social sharing / public cookbooks | Growth feature — not needed to deliver the gift |
| Safari / Chrome share extension | "Share to Spoon & Sketch" from any browser; Telegram bot covers import in v1 |
| Offline-first canvas editing | Full offline needs local SQLite + sync logic; MMKV cache covers most cases |
| Multiple bot languages | Bot is English-only in v1; UI already supports EN + UK |
| Subscription billing tiers | Validate pricing model before locking in tiers |
| AI recipe suggestions | "You might like…" based on your cookbook; v2 engagement feature |
| Voice step narration in Cook Mode | Useful but not core to the gift use case |

---

## User flow — signup to first completed page

This is the critical path. Every friction point here costs users.

```
1. INSTALL
   └─ Onboarding splash (app logo, stickers, "Get started")

2. ONBOARDING (5 steps, no account yet)
   ├─ Value prop: "Make a cookbook as a gift"
   ├─ Demo: "Make me Sketch" before/after
   ├─ Import options shown (Telegram / URL / manual)
   ├─ Intent picker: "A gift" OR "My own cookbook"
   └─ Palette picker: choose style

3. SIGN UP
   └─ Magic link (email) OR Apple OR Google
       └─ First cookbook auto-created from intent choice

4. HOME
   └─ "Your shelves" shows the new cookbook
       └─ "Add your first recipe" prompt

5. ADD A RECIPE (three paths, all land in same place)
   ├─ A. Paste link → Haiku extracts → review form → Save
   ├─ B. Upload screenshot → Haiku extracts → review form → Save
   └─ C. Type manually → fill form → Save

6. DECORATE
   ├─ From recipe detail: tap "Make it a scrapbook page"
   ├─ Tap "Make me Sketch" → AI places stickers automatically
   └─ User adjusts / adds more elements if desired

7. BUILD THE BOOK
   ├─ Open Book Builder
   ├─ Cover page: title + photo + palette
   ├─ Dedication page: write message with Pencil / touch
   └─ Recipe pages auto-populated from decorated recipes

8. EXPORT / PRINT
   ├─ PDF export → download or share
   └─ Print order → enter recipient address → pay → Lulu ships
```

**Shortest possible happy path:** install → sign up → paste one link → Make me Sketch → export PDF → under 5 minutes.

## Backend needs

| Need | Solution | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| User auth | Supabase Auth | Magic link + Apple + Google. JWT stored in expo-secure-store. |
| Database | Supabase PostgreSQL | 14 tables, full schema in this file. RLS on every table. |
| File storage | Supabase Storage | Buckets: `recipe-images`, `user-images`, `canvas-thumbnails`, `pdf-exports`. CDN included. |
| Realtime | Supabase Realtime | Recipe appears in app the moment Telegram bot saves it. Also used for print order status updates. |
| AI processing queue | BullMQ + Redis (Upstash) | All Haiku calls are async. Never block the UI. Results pushed via Realtime. |
| Serverless functions | Supabase Edge Functions (Deno) | PDF generation, auto-sticker, telegram auth token exchange, recipe URL scraping |
| Telegram bot server | Telegraf.js on Railway | Always-on Node.js service. Receives Telegram webhooks, pushes to BullMQ. |
| PDF generation | Puppeteer inside Edge Function | Renders HTML template with embedded PNG canvas snapshots |
| Email | Supabase Auth built-in | Magic link emails only. No custom email service needed in v1. |
| Push notifications | Expo Push Notifications | "Your print order has shipped", "Recipe imported from Telegram" |

**No custom auth server, no separate API server.** Supabase Edge Functions cover all backend logic. The only separate service is the Telegram bot (must be always-on for webhook).

---

## APIs needed

| API | Purpose | Auth type | Cost model |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic API** (Claude Haiku) | Recipe extraction from URL/image, auto-sticker placement | API key (server-side only, never expose to client) | Per token. Haiku is ~25× cheaper than Sonnet. Enable prompt caching. |
| **Telegram Bot API** | Receive recipe links/screenshots from users via bot | Bot token (Telegraf) | Free |
| **Lulu xPress API** | Submit print orders, get pricing, track status | OAuth2 / API key | Per order (Lulu takes margin, you mark up) |
| **RevenueCat API** | In-app purchases, subscription management | API key | Free up to $2.5k MRR, then 1% |
| **Supabase API** | Database, auth, storage, realtime, edge functions | Anon key (client) + Service role key (server) | Free tier generous; paid from ~$25/mo |
| **Expo Push API** | Send push notifications to iOS/Android | Expo access token | Free |
| **Google Fonts** | Load Fraunces, Caveat, Nunito | No auth (CDN) | Free |
| **Apple Sign In** | Required for App Store if offering any social login | Apple Developer account | Free (requires $99/yr dev account) |
| **Google Sign In** | Optional social login | Google Cloud Console OAuth | Free |

**Keys that must NEVER be in client-side code:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `LULU_API_KEY`, Supabase service role key. All Haiku calls go through Supabase Edge Functions.

## Monetization options

Three realistic models for this app. Decision is still open (see Open questions).

### Option A — Freemium (recommended)
Free tier is genuinely useful; premium unlocks the best parts.

| | Free | Premium (~$5–8/mo or ~$40/yr) |
|---|---|---|
| Cookbooks | 3 | Unlimited |
| Recipes | 30 | Unlimited |
| Built-in stickers | Essentials pack only (~28 after Phase 8.5A) | All 4 packs (~76 stickers) + future packs |
| PDF export | Watermarked | No watermark |
| Print orders | 1/month | Unlimited |
| AI auto-sticker | 5 uses/month | Unlimited |
| Telegram bot | ✅ | ✅ Priority queue |

Revenue from subscriptions (RevenueCat) + print order markup (Lulu cost + your margin).

### Option B — One-time purchase (~$4.99)
Single upfront payment, all features unlocked. Simple.
- No recurring revenue
- Good for App Store featuring ("pay once, keep forever" angle)
- Add-on: sticker packs as separate IAP ($0.99–$1.99 each)

### Option C — Print-first, app is free
App is completely free. Revenue comes exclusively from print orders.
- Low barrier to adoption
- Depends on conversion to print (risky if users just export PDF)
- Lulu wholesale + markup (~$8–15 per book depending on size)

**My recommendation:** Option A (freemium). The AI features (auto-sticker, Telegram bot) are the natural premium gate — they have real running costs and are the most magical parts of the product. Print markup provides secondary revenue regardless of tier.

---

## MVP scope — what ships in v1

Everything in this list ships. Nothing else.

**Screens (18 total):**
Onboarding (7 steps) · Home · Library (shelf + index) · Import Recipe · Create/Edit Recipe · Detail (scrapbook + clean) · Canvas Editor (canvas + templates + drawing mode) · Cook Mode · Collections · My Elements · PDF Export · Book Builder · Book page editors (cover, dedication, about, chapter divider) · Print Order · Telegram Connect · Profile & Settings · Plans & Pricing · Tablet/Web layout

**Features:**
- Email magic link + Apple Sign In auth
- Recipe CRUD (manual + URL import + screenshot import + Telegram bot)
- 16 built-in PNG stickers (Phase 8.5A grows this to ~76 across 4 packs)
- Canvas editor: stickers, washi tape, text, photos, templates
- Freehand drawing: layers, blend modes, Apple Pencil pressure
- "Make me Sketch" auto-decoration
- Book builder with all page types
- 4 palette themes
- PDF export (scrapbook + clean styles, A4 + A5)
- Print-on-demand via Lulu xPress
- Cook Mode with screen-on
- English + Ukrainian UI
- Freemium tiers via RevenueCat
- Push notifications (print shipped, recipe imported)
- iOS + Web (one codebase, Expo)

---

## What to avoid building at the start

| Avoid | Reason |
|---|---|
| Android | Validate product on iOS + Web first. Expo makes the port trivial once you have a stable build. |
| Custom auth server | Supabase Auth handles everything. Do not build JWT issuance yourself. |
| Rolling your own IAP | RevenueCat exists. In-app purchase is a compliance minefield — don't touch it raw. |
| Real-time collaborative editing | Adds operational transforms / CRDTs complexity. No use case requires it in v1. |
| Offline-first full sync | MMKV cache + Supabase Realtime is sufficient. Full offline (SQLite + conflict resolution) is weeks of extra work. |
| Family sharing / cookbook permissions | Adds multi-user data model complexity. Private cookbooks only in v1. |
| Social feed / public cookbooks | Discovery and social graph are separate products. Not needed for the gift use case. |
| Custom email service | Supabase magic link emails are fine for v1. Do not set up SendGrid/Postmark yet. |
| Template marketplace | Needs seller accounts, revenue split, moderation. Post-launch. |
| Your own print infrastructure | Lulu xPress exists and is reliable. Do not build print pipelines. |
| Scraping every recipe site perfectly | Handle the common sites (NYT Cooking, Smitten Kitchen, BBC Good Food). Graceful degradation for everything else — show what was extracted and let the user fix it. |

## Design source

The visual design lives in `.claude/samples/scrabooka-design/scrabooka/project/`.
The prototype is called "Scookie" internally. The production app is **Spoon & Sketch**.

Key design files:
- `styles.css` — all design tokens, clay button styles, paper grain, typography
- `ui.jsx` — Icon, FoodImage, Tag, Meta, StatusBar, Phone, TabBar components
- `stickers.jsx` — all 16 SVG sticker definitions (100×100 viewBox each)
- `screens-core.jsx` — Welcome, Library, CreateRecipe, Detail screens
- `screens-creative.jsx` — Editor, CookMode, Collections, MyElements, PDFExport

Implement pixel-faithfully in React Native. Match visual output; do not copy
prototype internal structure.

---

## Tech stack

| Layer | Package | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Expo SDK 52 + TypeScript | iOS + Android + Web from one codebase |
| Navigation | Expo Router (file-based) | Works with web SSR, deep links |
| Canvas / drawing | `@shopify/react-native-skia` | Runs on iOS, Android, Web (WebAssembly/CanvasKit). Handles sticker rendering, path drawing, layer compositing, blend modes, snapshot to PNG |
| Stroke smoothing | `perfect-freehand` (MIT, 2KB) | Smooth pressure-sensitive strokes from raw pointer events. No bezier math needed. |
| SVG stickers | `react-native-svg` | Render 16 built-in stickers on all platforms |
| Gestures | `react-native-gesture-handler` | Pan, pinch, rotate for sticker transforms; pointer events for Apple Pencil pressure |
| Fonts | `expo-font` | Fraunces + Caveat + Nunito from Google Fonts |
| State (canvas/local) | `zustand` | Canvas element transforms, undo/redo stack, drawing tool state |
| State (server) | `@tanstack/react-query` | Recipe fetching, mutations, cache |
| Local storage | `expo-secure-store` + `@react-native-mmkv/core` | Session tokens (secure), fast cache (MMKV) |
| Database / Auth / Storage | `@supabase/supabase-js` | PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Realtime + Edge Functions in one. Row Level Security for multi-user isolation. |
| AI | `@anthropic-ai/sdk` | Claude Haiku for recipe extraction and auto-sticker placement |
| Telegram bot | `telegraf` (Node.js) | Deployed on Railway. Handles webhook, sends jobs to queue. |
| Job queue | `bullmq` + Redis (Upstash) | Async AI processing. Never blocks UI. Results pushed via Supabase Realtime. |
| PDF generation | Puppeteer (Supabase Edge Function) | Server-side PDF from canvas snapshots + recipe data |
| Print-on-demand | Lulu xPress REST API | User pays in-app → Lulu prints and ships physical book to any address |
| Animations | `react-native-reanimated` | Sticker placement animations, canvas transitions |
| i18n | `i18next` + `react-i18next` + `expo-localization` | English + Ukrainian. Device language auto-detected. Cyrillic covered by all 3 chosen fonts (Nunito, Fraunces, Caveat support Ukrainian via Google Fonts — no font swap needed) |

### Web note
Expo Router with React Native Web. React Native Skia renders on web via CanvasKit
(~8MB WASM). Bundle is heavier but acceptable for a creative tool with long session times.
The tablet editor design from the prototype IS the web/desktop layout — dark sidebar,
wide canvas, right panel.

### Apple Pencil note
`react-native-gesture-handler` pointer events expose `pressure` (0–1) on Apple Pencil.
Pass directly to `perfect-freehand` options. No additional native module needed for v1.

Content:
- Connect Telegram button → deep link to bot with auth token
- Once connected: shows @username, disconnect option
- Bot instructions: "Send me any recipe link or photo"

> **Note:** Final pricing tiers depend on the unanswered business model question.
> This spec covers the screen structure; fill in prices once decided.

Content:
- Header: "Choose your plan" (Fraunces display)
- Two plan cards side by side (or stacked on small phone):

**Free tier card:**
- Price: $0
- Features:
  - Up to 3 cookbooks

---

### 17 · Order history

> **🔴 LAUNCH BLOCKER — not yet implemented.** Required so users can see their print orders' status. Without this, "where's my Mother's Day cookbook?" has no answer in the app.

**Route:** `/me/orders`

Content:
- Reverse-chronological list of the user's `print_orders` rows.
- Per-row card: cookbook thumbnail, title, format (A5 Soft / A5 Hard / A4 Hard), placed-on date, status pill (Pending · Processing · Shipped · Delivered · Failed), shipping address (truncated), price.
- Tappable row → order detail screen with: full status timeline, Lulu tracking link (if shipped), order ID, gift recipient if applicable, "Reorder" button (re-opens print flow with same details pre-filled).
- Empty state: "No print orders yet" + CTA "Order your first cookbook".

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] List sorted by `print_orders.created_at desc`
- [ ] Status updates from Lulu webhook reflect within ~5 s via Supabase Realtime on `print_orders`
- [ ] Tracking URL deep-links out to Lulu / carrier
- [ ] RLS scopes the list to the current user only

---

### 18 · Manage Subscription

> **🔴 LAUNCH BLOCKER — not yet implemented.** Apple Store requires a Restore Purchases button accessible from the app for any IAP. Currently planned only as an acceptance bullet on §16; it needs its own surface.

**Route:** `/me/subscription`

Content:
- Current plan card (Free / Premium) with badge and benefits summary.
- For Premium: renewal date, billing cycle (monthly/annual), price, "Manage in App Store" button (deep-link to `itms-apps://...subscriptions`), "Cancel subscription" copy directing to App Store (Apple owns cancellation).
- For Free: "Upgrade to Premium" CTA → §16 Plans & Pricing.
- **Restore Purchases** secondary button (always visible, both tiers) — calls RevenueCat `restorePurchases()` and refreshes `users.tier`.
- Last successful restore timestamp (debug aid).
- Receipt verification status (live from RevenueCat).

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Restore Purchases button calls RevenueCat SDK and reflects updated entitlements within 2 s
- [ ] Cancel subscription deep-link opens the App Store subscription management screen for this app
- [ ] Renewal date pulled from RevenueCat `customerInfo.entitlements.active['premium'].expirationDate`
- [ ] Cross-platform restoration works (purchase on iOS, opens on web → tier shows Premium)

---

### 19 · Data Export (GDPR / right-to-portability)

> **🔴 LAUNCH BLOCKER for EU launch — not yet implemented.** GDPR Art. 20 right to data portability. Also a strong trust signal in any market.

**Route:** Settings → "Export my data" button (§15 Profile & Settings)

Flow:
- Tap "Export my data" → confirmation: "We'll email you a JSON file with all your recipes, cookbooks, and account data. This may take up to 5 minutes."
- Edge Function `export-user-data` packages: `users` row (excluding push tokens), all `cookbooks`, all `recipes` (with ingredients/instructions/tags as JSON), all `print_orders`, `telegram_connections` (handle only), `ai_jobs` summary counts. Excludes: signed URLs (expired), service-internal IDs.
- Output: signed URL to a JSON file in Storage (24-hour TTL), emailed to the user via Supabase Auth's email infrastructure (or transactional email provider).
- Rate-limited to 1 export per 24 hours per user.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Export job runs server-side (no PII in client logs)
- [ ] JSON output validates against a documented schema (publish in `BACKEND.md` §"Data export shape")
- [ ] Sensitive fields excluded (push token, OAuth tokens, raw service-role-only columns)
- [ ] Email arrives within 5 minutes for a typical user (~50 recipes)
- [ ] Repeat-export attempts within 24 h return a "still processing / please wait" message, not a duplicate run

---

### 20 · Email change / account recovery

> **🟡 PRE-LAUNCH — not yet implemented.** Magic-link auth means no passwords, but users still lose access to their email or want to switch to a new one. Without this, "I lost my login email" is unrecoverable.

**Route:** Settings → "Change email" (§15 Profile & Settings)

Flow:
- "Change email" opens a screen: shows current email (read-only), input for new email.
- Submitting sends a verification magic link to the NEW email; tapping it confirms the change. The OLD email also receives a "your email was changed" notification with a "this wasn't me" recovery link.
- Recovery link (sent to old email): 7-day window to revert the change, useful if account was compromised.
- Edge case: user has lost access to BOTH old AND new email — manual support flow (out of scope for v1; document a `support@spoonsketch.app` contact).

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Verification link required on the new email before the change takes effect
- [ ] Old email receives a notification; revert link works for 7 days
- [ ] Apple Sign In users see "Manage Apple ID" deep-link instead (Apple owns that email)
- [ ] Updated email reflects in `users.email` AND in Supabase `auth.users.email` consistently

---

## Compliance & legal — pre-launch

> **Source for Ukraine items:** legal-research output 2026-04-25. Reference: Ukrainian Law on Personal Data Protection (No. 2297-VI), language law (No. 2704-VIII), Draft Law No. 8153 (GDPR harmonization, pending second reading). Items also marked best-practice for EU/GDPR alignment.

### C1 · Legal documents (Privacy Policy + Terms of Service)

> **🔴 LAUNCH BLOCKER for Ukrainian users.** Cannot accept signups from Ukraine without these.

- **Privacy Policy** must disclose:
  - Data categories collected (account, content, behavioral, payment, location implicit via IP)
  - Lawful basis per category (consent for AI, contract for print, legitimate interest for analytics)
  - Cross-border transfers to US vendors (Anthropic, OpenAI, Supabase, Stripe, RevenueCat, Sentry, PostHog) — reference DPAs / SCCs as the safeguard mechanism
  - **AI processing disclosure**: "We send recipe text / photos / PDFs to Anthropic Haiku for extraction; selected photos to OpenAI gpt-image-1 for stylized effects. Your data is not used to train AI models." Both vendors' opt-out-of-training terms cited.
  - Data subject rights: access, correction, deletion, portability — and the in-app surfaces that fulfil each (Settings → Delete account / Export data / Email change)
  - Retention periods (account active = retained; deletion = 30-day soft delete then purge)
  - Contact: `privacy@spoonsketch.app` (set up the mailbox)
- **Terms of Service** must include:
  - Print orders are personalized goods → **14-day withdrawal right does NOT apply** (EU CRD exemption). State this explicitly in checkout copy.
  - Subscription auto-renewal disclosure (App Store rules + FTC click-to-cancel)
  - User-content licensing (we display + print user content; we do NOT use it for marketing without separate opt-in)
- **Ukrainian translations** of both documents — required by Ukraine's language law for any consumer-facing service operating in Ukraine. English-only is non-compliant.
- **Hosting**: served from a stable HTTPS URL (e.g. `spoonsketch.app/privacy` / `/terms`). Linked in: app footer, sign-up screen, App Store listing, every marketing email.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Privacy Policy + ToS drafted by legal counsel (lawyer review, not just an AI draft)
- [ ] Both documents available in EN + UK at stable URLs
- [ ] Linked from sign-up, Settings → About, App Store listing
- [ ] Effective date + last-updated timestamp on each

### C2 · Granular consent + marketing opt-in

> **✅ Engineering landed 2026-04-25.** Privacy Policy + ToS (§C1) still pending — once those documents exist, bump `CURRENT_PP_VERSION` in `src/api/consent.ts` and existing users get re-prompted on next sign-in.

Sign-up flow (Onboarding §00 step 7) gains 4 separate, **unchecked** checkboxes:
1. **Required**: "I agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy" (cannot proceed without)
2. **Optional**: "Process my recipes / photos / PDFs through AI services (Anthropic, OpenAI) so the app can extract structured recipes and generate stylized stickers/borders." — required for any AI feature; if unchecked, AI tabs (URL/Photo/File/JSON, Make-me-Sketch, watercolor) are disabled with a soft prompt to enable in Settings.
3. **Optional**: "Use my mailing address to fulfil print orders (sent to Lulu xPress)." — required only when placing a print order; can defer.
4. **Optional**: "Send me product updates and tips by email or push." — gates marketing channel; transactional emails (order status, password recovery) always send regardless.

Settings → Privacy panel mirrors all four toggles; user can revoke at any time. Revoking #2 disables AI features client-side AND clears any cached AI artifacts within 24h.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] All four boxes are unchecked by default
- [ ] Each toggle persists to a new `users.consent_*` column or `user_consents` table with timestamp + version-of-PP-at-time-of-consent
- [ ] Revoking AI consent disables Make-me-Sketch / URL import / Photo import / File import / JSON import / watercolor immediately
- [ ] Revoking marketing consent unsubscribes from PostHog email + push within 24h
- [ ] Consent log retained for audit (date, version, IP at time of grant) per Art. 7 GDPR + Ukraine equivalent

### C3 · Data subject rights — operational

Most surfaces are already specced; a few operational additions are needed.

- **In-app deletion** (§15) ✅ planned — satisfies both Apple Guideline 5.1.1(v) and Ukraine deletion right.
- **Data export** (§19) ✅ planned — satisfies GDPR Art. 20 portability right.
- **Email change** (§20) ✅ planned — satisfies rectification right.
- **NEW: Change-notification flow** — Ukraine law requires notifying users of any changes affecting their personal data within **10 business days**. Implementation: a transactional email triggered when a privileged operation runs on a user's data (e.g. service-role admin action, terms update with material change, third-party data sharing change). For v1, just send an email when ToS/PP change materially.
- **NEW: `privacy@spoonsketch.app` mailbox** — set up + monitor. SLA: 30 days to respond per GDPR / 30 days under Ukrainian law. Document the inbound flow (auto-acknowledge + ticket).
- **NEW: Ombudsman filing** — Ukrainian DPA notification (free, 30 working days from start of processing) IF processing user-uploaded photos qualifies as "high-risk" data. Form at `ombudsman.gov.ua`. Decision: file proactively to be safe.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] `privacy@spoonsketch.app` exists and routes to a real human
- [ ] ToS/PP-change email template exists, tested
- [ ] Ombudsman filing submitted (or documented decision not to)

### C4 · Vendor Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)

Sign DPAs with every vendor that processes user data on our behalf. Most are click-through or auto-included in standard ToS; some require manual signing.

| Vendor | DPA path | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | Auto-included in API ToS (zero-retention by default for Workbench / API) | ⏳ Verify ZDR opt-in for our org |
| OpenAI | DPA at platform.openai.com → Settings → Data controls; requires DPA email | ⏳ Pending |
| Supabase | Self-serve at supabase.com/dpa | ⏳ Pending |
| RevenueCat | Self-serve at app.revenuecat.com → Settings → Compliance | ⏳ Pending |
| Stripe | Auto-included in Stripe Services Agreement; verify via dashboard | ⏳ Pending |
| Lulu xPress | Contact account manager; standard form | ⏳ Pending |
| PostHog | Self-serve at posthog.com/handbook/legal/dpa | ⏳ Pending |
| Sentry | Self-serve at sentry.io/legal/dpa | ⏳ Pending |
| Railway (bot host) | Self-serve at railway.com/legal | ⏳ Pending |
| Telegram (BotFather) | Telegram is the controller for handle/ID we receive; reference their privacy policy in ours; no DPA needed | n/a |

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] All DPAs signed and stored in a shared drive (path documented in this section)
- [ ] Privacy Policy lists every vendor + its purpose

### C5 · App Store Connect configuration

> **🔴 LAUNCH BLOCKER — submission will be rejected without these.**

- **Privacy Nutrition Labels** — fill out App Store Connect's data collection questionnaire to match what's actually collected:
  - Identifiers: User ID (Supabase UUID), Device ID (PostHog session)
  - Contact Info: Email (account), Physical Address (print orders only)
  - User Content: Photos, Recipes, Drawings — linked to identity, used for App Functionality
  - Purchases: linked to identity
  - Usage Data: linked to identity (PostHog), App Functionality + Analytics
  - Diagnostics: Crash Data (Sentry), App Functionality
- **Age rating: 12+** — UGC = Yes (users post photos + text); Frequent/Intense Mature/Suggestive Themes = No; gambling = No.
- **Sign in with Apple** — required if any social login exists (Guideline 4.8). Add to onboarding §00 step 7. Already noted as launch blocker but call out under Apple too.
- **Restore Purchases** button — already specced in §18 Manage Subscription. Apple Guideline 3.1.1.
- **In-app account deletion** (§15) — Apple Guideline 5.1.1(v). Already specced.
- **Subscription disclosure** near the subscribe button (Plans §16): price, renewal cadence, free-trial terms, link to ToS+PP. Apple Guideline 3.1.2(a).
- **Push notification consent** flow per `expo-notifications` standard. No marketing-only push without separate opt-in (covered by §C2 box 4).
- **App Tracking Transparency (ATT)** prompt — only required if any third-party SDK does cross-app tracking. PostHog + Sentry don't by default; verify config.
- **Subscription pricing display** must match what App Store charges (RevenueCat fetches Apple's product, so this stays in sync as long as we don't hardcode prices in the app — already the case).
- **Privacy Policy URL** in App Store Connect listing (same URL as in §C1).

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Privacy Nutrition Labels match the actual collection on first submission
- [ ] Age rating set 12+
- [ ] Subscription disclosure copy reviewed against Guideline 3.1.2(a) checklist
- [ ] Push opt-in does not solicit marketing pushes without explicit consent
- [ ] ATT prompt shown ONLY if a tracking SDK is detected (verify with Xcode privacy report)

### C6 · USA — CCPA / CPRA / COPPA / state privacy / sales tax

> **🔴 LAUNCH BLOCKER for US.** Triggers if any user from California, Virginia, Connecticut, Texas, Colorado, etc. signs up.

- **CCPA / CPRA (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 et seq.)** — Privacy Policy (§C1) must include a "California Privacy Rights" section listing: PI categories collected, purposes, third-party recipients, all consumer rights (know / delete / correct / opt-out of sale-or-sharing / limit sensitive PI use). Even though we don't sell data, state "Do Not Sell or Share" affirmatively. Honor rights requests within 45 days (one 45-day extension permitted with notice).
- **COPPA (15 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6506)** — age gate at registration: DOB field or "I am 13 or older" confirmation. Privacy Policy: "We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13." Lives in Onboarding §00 step 7.
- **California ARL (Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17600–17606, AB 2863 amendments)** — auto-renewal disclosure copy IMMEDIATELY before the Subscribe button (not in ToS): "You will be charged [price] every [period]. Your subscription renews automatically until cancelled. Cancel anytime in Settings → Subscription." + separate affirmative checkbox for the auto-renewal. Lives in §16 Plans & Pricing.
- **VCDPA (Va. Code §§ 59.1-575) / CTDPA (PA 22-15) / others** — a CCPA-compliant Privacy Policy mostly covers them. Add "State Privacy Rights" multi-state section. Use IAPP State Privacy Law tracker for new enactments.
- **Sales tax on print orders** — economic nexus per *South Dakota v. Wayfair* (~$100K revenue or 200 transactions per state). Books taxable in most states. Stripe Tax integration handles collection; confirm with Lulu whether they collect on their end.
- **ATT (App Tracking Transparency)** — audit PostHog SDK. If first-party only (no IDFA, no cross-app tracking), set `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` but don't call `requestTrackingAuthorization`. If any tracking SDK is present, show the prompt.
- **FTC Click-to-Cancel** (vacated July 2025) — the rule is dead but FTC enforcement under ROSCA + Section 5 still active. Design subscription UX as if it were in force: cancellation no harder than signup, accurate disclosure copy, no dark patterns. Match.com / Chegg / Cleo AI / Amazon enforcement actions establish the de facto standard.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Privacy Policy has a "California Privacy Rights" + multi-state section
- [ ] COPPA age gate at signup
- [ ] California ARL disclosure copy adjacent to Subscribe button
- [ ] Stripe Tax wired for US print-order checkout
- [ ] Cancellation flow at Settings → Subscription is one-tap (§18)

### C7 · EU — GDPR / ePrivacy / EU Rep / DSA / EAA / CRD

> **🔴 LAUNCH BLOCKER for EU.** Triggers if any EU resident signs up.

- **GDPR Art. 6 lawful basis** per category: account=Contract, print=Contract, AI=Contract+Consent, marketing=Consent, analytics=Legitimate Interests (with LIA) OR Consent. Documented in RoPA (§C9).
- **GDPR Art. 13 disclosures** at point of collection — covered by Privacy Policy §C1.
- **GDPR Arts. 15–22 data subject rights** — access (§19 export), rectification (§15 + §20), erasure (§15 delete), restriction (privacy@), portability (§19), objection (privacy@), no-automated-decision (AI is user-reviewed, not binding — document in PP).
- **ePrivacy cookie/analytics consent banner** — EU users see CMP banner at first launch with **reject-all parity to accept-all** (per CJEU *Planet49* + national DPA guidance). Reject button equally prominent; no pre-ticked boxes; gate PostHog initialization on consent. Sentry as legitimate-interests / strictly-necessary security.
- **GDPR Art. 27 EU Representative** — required because we have no EU establishment. Use DataRep / VeraSafe / Prighter (~€500–€2,000/year). Contact in Privacy Policy.
- **GDPR Art. 33 — 72-hour breach notification** — designate lead DPA (Germany or Ireland). Incident response runbook + Supabase access logging.
- **GDPR Art. 46 transfer mechanisms** — DPAs + SCCs with all US vendors (§C4). Anthropic + OpenAI auto-incorporated; rest manual. Prefer EU regions for PostHog + Sentry.
- **DSA Art. 16 notice-and-action** — micro-enterprise exemption: <10 employees AND <€2M turnover. Above threshold: in-app "Report content" button + uploader notification. At launch we're exempt; build the Report button for Apple Guideline 1.2 anyway (P2 in §C8).
- **EU Consumer Rights Directive — 14-day withdrawal waiver (Dir. 2011/83/EU Art. 16(c))** — printed cookbook is "personalized" → exempt. Explicit ToS clause: *"Your printed cookbook is a custom, personalized product made to your specifications. In accordance with Art. 16(c) of EU Directive 2011/83, the 14-day right of withdrawal does not apply to this order. Defective or incorrectly printed items will be replaced free of charge."*
- **EU Accessibility Act (Dir. 2019/882)** — effective June 28, 2025. Same micro-enterprise exemption as DSA. Above threshold: WCAG 2.1 Level AA + Accessibility Statement. At launch document micro-enterprise status; as we grow: VoiceOver/TalkBack labels, 4.5:1 contrast, text scaling.

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] EU Representative contracted; address in Privacy Policy
- [ ] CMP cookie banner deployed; PostHog gated on consent
- [ ] ToS contains the 14-day-waiver clause for printed cookbooks
- [ ] Incident response runbook documented; lead DPA chosen

### C8 · Apple App Store — submission gates

> **🔴 LAUNCH BLOCKER.** App Store submission will be rejected without these.

Most surfaces specced elsewhere; this section is the consolidated checklist:

- **Sign in with Apple** (Guideline 4.8) — required because we offer email magic-link / Google. Implement in Onboarding §00 step 7 via `expo-apple-authentication` + Supabase Apple OAuth.
- **Restore Purchases** (Guideline 3.1.1) — on paywall + Settings (§18).
- **In-app account deletion** (Guideline 5.1.1(v)) — full delete, not deactivate; also send deletion to Anthropic/OpenAI per DPA. Lives in §15.
- **Privacy Nutrition Labels** in App Store Connect — accurate map of categories collected.
- **Privacy Policy URL** on the listing — same URL as §C1.
- **Subscription disclosure copy** near Subscribe button (Guideline 3.1.2(a)) — see §C6 + §16.
- **Print orders use Stripe, not IAP** (Guideline 3.1.1) — physical goods are exempt from IAP. Document in App Review Notes.
- **Age rating: 12+** — UGC = Yes (photos, recipes).
- **UGC moderation** (Guideline 1.2) — "Report a problem" button on recipe detail + CSAM scanning on photo upload (§C10).
- **Push consent** (Guideline 4.5.4) — request only when contextually relevant; marketing pushes need separate opt-in (covered by §C2 box 4).
- **ATT** — only if a tracking SDK is detected; verify PostHog config (§C6).
- **App Store Connect metadata** ready: 6.5" iPhone screenshots, 12.9" iPad if supported, optional preview video (15-30s on-device), description (4000), keywords (100), promo text (170, changeable), support URL, privacy URL, marketing URL.
- **Demo account credentials** in App Review Notes — required for any account-gated app. Use a dedicated review account with realistic seeded data.

Acceptance criteria: tracked under §15 / §16 / §18 / §19 / §C1 / §C5 / §C9.

### C9 · Cross-cutting — RoPA, breach response, CSAM, watch lists

- **Records of Processing Activities (RoPA, GDPR Art. 30)** — internal spreadsheet/Notion doc documenting every processing activity: purpose, legal basis, data categories, data subjects, recipients, retention, international transfers, security measures. Update on every new feature/vendor. Not published; available to regulators on request.
- **Incident response runbook (GDPR Art. 33)** — 72-hour breach notification process: who decides, who notifies, what template, who's the lead DPA. Supabase access logging + Sentry alerts as the inputs.
- **CSAM photo scanning** ✅ **landed 2026-04-25** — Apple Guideline 1.2 + 18 U.S.C. § 2258A NCMEC reporting. Wired via `moderate-image` Edge Function called after every photo upload (Photo tab via `src/api/storage.ts`, Telegram bot via `telegram-bot/src/bot.ts`). Detection backend: Claude Haiku 4.5 vision (not specialized CSAM detection like Microsoft PhotoDNA / Thorn Safer — that's the post-launch upgrade — but satisfies "a method for filtering objectionable material"). Fail-closed semantics: any scan error or non-safe verdict deletes the storage object before any signed URL is generated. Audit trail in `moderation_events` table (service-role only, RLS-locked). NCMEC review queue: rows with `reason='csam_suspect'`. PDFs out of scope v1.
- **Stripe Tax** for US sales tax — wire into print-order checkout once first US user signs up.
- **In-app "Report content" button** — visible on recipe detail. Apple Guideline 1.2 + DSA-readiness.
- **EAA WCAG 2.1 AA audit** — defer until we cross EU micro-enterprise threshold; document status now.
- **Watch list:**
  - Ukrainian **Draft Law No. 8153** (GDPR-harmonization) — adopted-as-basis Nov 2024, pending second reading. If passed: appoint local Ukrainian representative.
  - **State privacy laws** in the US — IAPP State Privacy Law tracker; new enactments quarterly.
  - **FTC Click-to-Cancel** — currently vacated; if re-introduced, our flow already complies.
  - **TIA for Anthropic + OpenAI** — Transfer Impact Assessment documenting US FISA 702 risk + mitigations (SCCs, minimal data, pseudonymization). Best practice; not required for small app.

### 00 · Onboarding (first launch only)

> **🔴 LAUNCH BLOCKER — not yet implemented.** First-launch carousel + sign-up is required before TestFlight / App Store submission. The 7-step structure below is an engineering placeholder; **final copy + visuals come from the marketing team** (4-6 killer-feature screens before "Get Started", then setup + sign-up). Engineering work after marketing delivers: carousel layout, MMKV `onboarding_complete` flag, Apple Sign In on the final step, deep-link bypass for already-authenticated users.

**Route:** `/onboarding` — shown once, skipped after completion stored in MMKV

Onboarding is 5 steps. No account required until step 5 — let users see the value first.

**Step 1 — Splash / Hero**
- Full-screen painterly food image background
- App logo: "Spoon & Sketch" in Fraunces (large) + Caveat subtitle "a scrapbook cookbook"
- Stickers scattered: tomato, leaf, cherry decorating the screen
- "Get started" primary clay button
- "I already have an account" text link → goes to sign in

**Step 2 — The gift angle**
- Headline: "Make a cookbook someone will keep forever" (Fraunces)
- Subtext: "Decorate recipes with stickers, add a handwritten dedication, order a real printed book."
- Illustration: polaroid-style mockup of a finished cookbook page (use FoodImage + stickers)
- Progress dots (1 of 3)

**Step 3 — Zero effort, beautiful result**
- Headline: "Beautiful with one tap"
- Subtext: "Hit "Make me Sketch" and the app decorates your recipe automatically."
- Animation or static: before (plain recipe) → after (stickered scrapbook page)
- Progress dots (2 of 3)

**Step 4 — Import from anywhere**
- Headline: "Add recipes your way"
- Three options illustrated:
  - Telegram bot — send a link, get a recipe
  - Paste a URL — any recipe site
  - Type it yourself
- Progress dots (3 of 3)

**Step 5 — Intent picker** ← sets up the first cookbook automatically
- Headline: "What are you making?" (Fraunces)
- Two large cards (tap to select):
  - 🎁 "A gift for someone" — "I'll make a cookbook to give away"
  - 📖 "My own cookbook" — "I'm building my personal recipe collection"
- Selection creates the first cookbook with an appropriate default title

**Step 6 — Palette picker**
- Headline: "Pick your style" (Caveat)
- 4 palette swatches full-width (Terracotta · Sage · Blush · Cobalt), each shows a mini
  preview of what the app looks like in that palette
- Can be changed later in Settings

**Step 7 — Sign up / Sign in**
- Shown last — user already sees value before being asked to commit
- Email + magic link (no password, lower friction)
- "Or continue with Apple" (required for App Store)
- "Or continue with Google"
- First cookbook from step 5 is created immediately after auth

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Onboarding never shows again after completion (MMKV flag `onboarding_complete`)
- [ ] Skipping sign up is NOT possible — auth required to save data
- [ ] Intent from step 5 pre-fills first cookbook title: "A gift for [name]" or "[Your name]'s Cookbook"
- [ ] Palette from step 6 saved to `users.palette` on account creation
- [ ] "Continue with Apple" sign-in is functional (required for App Store approval)
- [ ] Deep linking into the app bypasses onboarding if already authenticated

---

### 18 · Tablet / Web Editor
**Route:** Same routes, layout adapts at breakpoint 768px+

Layout:
- Left sidebar (70px): app logo + tool icons (Layout · Stickers · Images · Text · Brush)
- Center canvas (fills remaining, min 500px): full recipe canvas
- Right panel (220px): contextual panel for active tool (sticker grid, layer panel, etc.)
- Top bar: page name · Preview · Save

Acceptance criteria:
- [ ] Responsive breakpoint at 768px width
- [ ] Right panel collapses to bottom sheet on phone
- [ ] Sticker grid in right panel is 3-col with category filters

---

## Database schema

> **The production-ready schema is in `BACKEND.md` § "Database Entities & Relationships".**
> That version adds: `update_updated_at()` trigger on every table, recipe/cookbook count triggers,
> `pg_trgm` full-text search index on recipe titles, corrected FK references (`public.` prefix),
> RLS policies for every table, and additional columns (`paper_texture`, `language`, `push_token`,
> `revenuecat_id`, `recipes_count`, `cookbooks_count` on users; `intent`, `recipient_name` on cookbooks;
> `cover_image_url`, corrected `source_type` values on recipes; `storage_path`, `width`, `height` on user_images;
> `gift_message`, `paid_at`, `shipped_at`, `lulu_status_raw` on print_orders).
> Use `BACKEND.md` as the authoritative schema when writing migrations.
> The abbreviated version below is kept for quick reference only.

### Row Level Security (all tables)
Every table has RLS enabled. Default policy: `user_id = auth.uid()`.
Cookbooks with `is_public = true` are readable by all authenticated users.
`telegram_jobs` and `ai_jobs` writable only by service role (bot/Edge Functions).

> Full RLS policy SQL (create policy statements for all 14 tables) is in `BACKEND.md` § "Row Level Security".
> Storage bucket policies are also in `BACKEND.md` § "File Upload Handling".

---

## AI features

### Claude Haiku model
Use `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`. It is fast and cheap — ideal for recipe extraction
and sticker matching. Do NOT use Sonnet or Opus for these tasks (cost vs. value).
Always enable prompt caching on system prompts (they are identical across calls).

### Recipe extraction prompt pattern
```typescript
// system prompt (cache this — it never changes, cache_control: ephemeral)
const EXTRACTION_SYSTEM = `You are a recipe extraction assistant.
Given a URL, scraped HTML, or image, extract the recipe as structured JSON.
Return exactly: { title, description, ingredients: [{name, amount, unit}],
instructions: [{step, text}], servings, prep_minutes, cook_minutes, tags }
Respond in the same language as the recipe content.
If the user's locale is 'uk', translate field labels to Ukrainian but keep
ingredient/step text in its original language unless it is already Ukrainian.`

// user prompt includes the content + user locale
const userPrompt = `Locale: ${userLocale}\nContent: ${scrapedContent}`
```

### i18n — English + Ukrainian

```
src/i18n/
  en.json    — all UI strings in English
  uk.json    — all UI strings in Ukrainian
```

Setup:
```typescript
import * as Localization from 'expo-localization'
import i18n from 'i18next'
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next'

i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
  lng: Localization.locale.startsWith('uk') ? 'uk' : 'en',
  fallbackLng: 'en',
  resources: { en: { translation: en }, uk: { translation: uk } },
})
```

User can override detected language in Settings.
Chosen fonts (Nunito, Fraunces, Caveat) all support Cyrillic/Ukrainian via
Google Fonts — no font swap needed.
Telegram bot reads `telegram_connections.language` (set on connect) and
responds in the user's language.
Claude Haiku responses use the user's locale passed in the prompt.

### Auto-sticker ("Make me Sketch") logic
```typescript
// 1. Send recipe title + ingredients to Haiku
// 2. Haiku returns [{stickerKey, x, y, rotation, scale, reasoning}]
// 3. Apply as canvas_elements with element_type='sticker'

// Built-in sticker keys and their AI keywords:

## Telegram bot

Deployed on Railway (Node.js service, always-on).

```
User sends link/screenshot to @spoonsketch_bot
→ Bot receives webhook (Telegraf)
→ Creates telegram_jobs row (status: pending)
→ Pushes job to BullMQ queue
→ Worker pulls job, calls Claude Haiku
→ Creates recipe in DB via service role
→ Updates telegram_jobs (status: done, recipe_id)
→ Bot sends reply: "Saved! [Recipe Title] — Open in app →"
→ Supabase Realtime pushes to app → recipe appears instantly
```

Auth flow: User taps "Connect Telegram" in app → receives one-time token →
sends token to bot → bot POSTs to Edge Function → creates telegram_connections row.

---

## PDF generation

Supabase Edge Function (Deno runtime).

Scrapbook PDF:
1. For each recipe page in book: call makeImageSnapshot on Skia canvas → PNG
2. Assemble pages: cover thumbnail + book pages in order
3. Use Puppeteer to render HTML template embedding PNGs
4. Return PDF binary, upload to Supabase Storage, write `pdf_exports` row

Clean PDF:
1. Server-side HTML template with recipe data
2. Nunito + Fraunces fonts embedded
3. No canvas images — pure typography layout

## Project file structure

> **The canonical folder structure is in `ARCHITECTURE.md` § "Folder Structure".**
> It is more granular than the version below and includes: `src/api/` (pure functions per entity),
> `src/hooks/queries/` + `src/hooks/mutations/` (TanStack Query hooks separated by read/write),
> `src/lib/` (analytics, sentry, revenuecat, mmkv, pdf, deeplink helpers), `src/types/` (generated DB types),
> the full `supabase/functions/` breakdown, and the `telegram-bot/` service structure.

## Team architecture rules

These rules apply to every developer on this project. They come from `ARCHITECTURE.md` and are repeated here so they are inescapable.

1. **Screens are thin.** A screen file imports hooks and renders components. No business logic in screen files.
2. **`src/api/` is pure.** No React imports. All functions are `async` and throw `ApiError`. Easy to test in isolation.
3. **Never put server data in Zustand.** Server data belongs to TanStack Query. Zustand is for UI state only (canvas elements, undo stack, theme, drawing tool settings).
4. **All Anthropic API calls go through Edge Functions.** The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must never appear in the app bundle. No exceptions.
5. **TypeScript strict mode, always.** Run `supabase gen types` after every migration to keep DB types in sync. No `any`.
6. **One analytics call per meaningful user action.** See `AnalyticsEvent` union type in `src/lib/analytics.ts` — adding an event requires updating the type first.
7. **Error boundaries wrap every tab root and the editor.** A crash in the canvas must never crash the whole app.

Screens are marketing-team-provided; engineering wires the carousel + MMKV `onboarding_complete` flag + Apple Sign In on the final step. See SCREENS.md §00 for the existing 7-step spec — current spec is the engineering placeholder; final copy/visuals come from marketing. **Cannot ship to TestFlight without this.** |
| 10.8 | Account management surfaces (order history, subscription manage, GDPR export, email change) | — | 🔴 **Launch blocker — not started** | Four account surfaces missing from the plan: (a) **Order history** `/me/orders` listing all `print_orders` rows with status + tracking; (b) **Manage subscription** `/me/subscription` showing current plan, renewal date, cancel button + **Restore Purchases** (Apple Store requires this for any IAP); (c) **GDPR data export** "Download my recipes + cookbooks as JSON" — required for EU users; (d) **Email change / recovery** flow — magic-link auth has no passwords but users still lose access to their email.

## Phase 8.5 — Photos, Frames & Watercolor

Detailed plan: `.claude/plans/wise-spinning-creek.md`. Five sub-phases, ~46h total:

- **A — Sticker expansion** (~6h): 16 → ~76 PNGs across 4 packs (Essentials free + Baking / Herbs / Holiday premium), generated via a `gpt-image-1` dev script. Premium packs gated server-side in `auto-sticker` Edge Function.
- **B — Recipe photo upload** (~8h): new private `recipe-photos` Storage bucket; `user_images.recipe_id` + `user_images.role` columns; new "Photo" tab in editor's bottom tray (upload / replace / remove).
- **C — Photo on canvas + frames** (~14h): `CanvasEl` discriminated-union refactor (sticker | photo); 8 hand-drawn SVG frames in `framesRegistry.ts`; Skia photo rendering with the same gesture set as stickers.
- **D — Watercolor via OpenAI** (~10h): new Edge Function `watercolor-image` calling `gpt-image-1`'s `images.edits`; premium-only with a 10/month cap; both original + painted user_images persist; canvas exposes an in-place toggle.
- **E — PDF export + docs + tests** (~8h): photos + frames inlined in `expo-print` HTML via base64; living docs (`FEATURES.md`, `BACKEND.md`, `MANUAL_TESTS.md`) caught up.

Sequencing: A standalone (content + UI gate). B → C → D is a hard chain. E closes the loop. Critical files: `src/lib/canvasStore.ts`, `src/lib/stickerRegistry.ts`, `supabase/functions/auto-sticker/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/_shared/{ai,tier}.ts`. Out of scope: persisting canvas elements to Supabase (stays Zustand+MMKV); shared/family canvases; >1 photo per recipe.

---

## Phase 10.5 — Editor UX polish (deferred)

Items intentionally skipped during Phase 5 to keep scope tight. Implement before launch.

### Help overlay (`?` button in editor) — ✅ Landed 2026-04-22
- `src/components/canvas/HelpSheet.tsx` renders a mode-aware bottom sheet: Layout / Stickers / Draw each get their own contextual tip list.
- Layout section walks through template picker, font picker, Arrange Blocks, move/rotate/scale, font-size bump, delete + reset.
- Stickers section covers add, move, pinch resize/rotate, delete.
- Draw section covers brush vs eraser, stroke size + colour, layers, blend modes (Normal / Multiply / Screen / Overlay / Soft Light explained), undo, auto-save.
- GIF demos were deferred — text-only sheet ships first; revisit after screen-recording tooling is set up.

### Drawing colour palette
- Current: 8 fixed colours from the app design system
- Desired: expand to ~16 colours + a custom colour picker (hue/saturation wheel or grid)
- Colour picker library candidates: `react-native-wheel-color-picker`, or a custom Skia-drawn wheel

### Other polish items
- ✅ Per-recipe drawing persistence (landed 2026-04-22, see `BUGS.md` BUG-014): `drawingStore` now persists a `drawings` map keyed by `recipeId`; every mutation snapshots into it and `init` loads from it on recipe switch.
- Apple Pencil pressure: wire `e.pressure` from the gesture event into `StrokePoint.pressure` for natural thinning (currently simulated at 0.5)
- ✅ **Edit recipe from Clean view** — landed 2026-04-25. Pencil icon `✎` in the Clean nav opens `/recipe/edit/<id>`. Form lives in `src/components/recipe/RecipeFormFields.tsx` (shared between create + edit); helpers in `src/lib/recipeForm.ts`. Note: structured ingredients (amount/unit/group) are flattened to plain text on save — round-tripping loses some structure but preserves visible content. Future polish: structured ingredient editor with separate amount/unit fields.

## Current state — handoff notes (updated 2026-04-20, Phase 4.5c added)

> **New Claude instance: read this before touching any code.**
> This section is the authoritative record of what was built and what is blocked.

### What is done

**Phase 4.5c — Draggable recipe blocks (added 2026-04-20):**

All 6 recipe page templates now use absolute-positioned `BlockElement` wrappers instead of flex layout. Each block can be selected, moved (pan), rotated (rotation handle or two-finger), scaled (pinch or scale handle), and deleted (soft-hide, restored via Reset).

New files:
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/blockDefs.ts` | `BlockDef`, `BlockOverride`, `BlockAbsoluteLayout` types + `TEMPLATE_BLOCKS` registry — 6 templates × 3–5 blocks each with `getDefault(pw)` functions |
| `src/components/canvas/BlockElement.tsx` | Gesture wrapper for arbitrary children. `editMode=false` → static `View` (no Reanimated). `editMode=true` → full pan/rotation/pinch + ↻ and □ handles + × delete button. Mirrors `CanvasElement` callback-ref + stable-wrapper pattern. |

Files modified:
- `src/lib/canvasStore.ts` — added `blockOverrides` (MMKV-persisted), `layoutResetVersion`, `setBlockOverride`, `removeBlock`, `clearBlockOverrides`; `setTemplateKey` shows Alert confirmation before clearing overrides
- `src/components/canvas/PageTemplates.tsx` — all templates converted to absolute BlockElement layout; `TemplateProps` extended with optional block-editing props; `useBlockResolver` helper resolves overrides + defaults; `makeBlockProps` reduces per-template boilerplate
- `app/editor/[recipeId].tsx` — "Arrange Blocks" toggle in Layout panel; `blockEditMode` + `selectedBlockId` local state; stickers disabled while in block-edit mode; panelHeight → 264 for layout mode
- `app/recipe/[id].tsx` — `blockOverrides` from store passed to `PageTemplate` in ScrapbookView

Coordinates: stored as fractions of `pageWidth`/`pageHeight` (device-independent). `layoutResetVersion` increments on reset → forces BlockElement key-based remount (clears stale Reanimated shared values). Deleted blocks stored with `hidden: true` in `blockOverrides`; restored via "Reset" button.

---

**Phase 4.5b — Handwriting font picker (added 2026-04-20):**

4 handwritten Google Fonts (all SIL OFL, all Cyrillic-supporting) selectable in the Layout tab below the template picker. Font choice persists per-recipe in canvasStore (MMKV). Fonts: Caveat (existing), Marck Script, Bad Script, Amatic SC.

New files:
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `src/components/canvas/FontPicker.tsx` | Horizontal scroll picker; each item shows "Recipe" in that font inside a bordered card |

Files modified:
- `src/lib/canvasStore.ts` — `FontPresetKey` type, `recipeFont` state, `setRecipeFont`, persisted
- `src/components/canvas/PageTemplates.tsx` — `FontPreset`/`FONT_PRESETS`/`resolvePreset`; `TemplateProps` extended; inline `fontFamily` overrides on title + all hand-text; `Steps`/`Tags` accept font string props
- `app/_layout.tsx` — 4 new font variants loaded in `useFonts()`
- `app/editor/[recipeId].tsx` — `FontPicker` below `TemplatePicker` in Layout mode; layout panel height → 220; `recipeFont` passed to `PageTemplate`
- `app/recipe/[id].tsx` — `recipeFont` from store passed to `PageTemplate`

---

**Phase 4.5a — Recipe page templates (added 2026-04-20):**

6 recipe layout templates implemented. Users choose a template via the `⊞ Layout` tab in the canvas editor; choice persists per recipe and is reflected in the Scrapbook view.

New files:
| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `src/components/canvas/PageTemplates.tsx` | `PageTemplate` switch component; 6 layouts (Classic, PhotoHero, Minimal, TwoColumn, Journal, RecipeCard); `TEMPLATES` metadata array for picker |
| `src/components/canvas/TemplatePicker.tsx` | Horizontal scroll picker with coloured box diagrams and labels |

Files modified:
- `src/lib/canvasStore.ts` — added `TemplateKey` type, `templateKey` state (default `'classic'`), `setTemplateKey` action, persisted to MMKV
- `app/editor/[recipeId].tsx` — removed old inline `PageBase`; added `layout` editor mode + `⊞ Layout` tab; panel renders `<TemplatePicker>`; canvas renders `<PageTemplate>`
- `app/recipe/[id].tsx` — `ScrapbookView` now renders `<PageTemplate>` instead of hardcoded layout; preview always matches editor choice

---

**Phase 5 code is fully written and TypeScript-clean.**
All 7 new files exist on disk:

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `src/types/drawing.ts` | `StrokePoint`, `DrawingStroke`, `DrawingLayer`, `BlendMode` types |
| `src/lib/drawingStore.ts` | Zustand store: 3 default layers, active layer, tool, width/color/opacity, undo stack, persist |
| `src/components/canvas/SkiaCanvas.tsx` | Skia `<Canvas>` with gesture-driven live stroke + committed layers; `isDrawing=false` → `pointerEvents="none"` |
| `src/components/canvas/DrawingLayer.tsx` | Skia `<Group opacity blendMode>` wrapping committed + live strokes |
| `src/components/canvas/DrawingStroke.tsx` | `perfect-freehand` → Skia Path fill; handles pressure thinning |
| `src/components/canvas/DrawingToolbar.tsx` | Brush/eraser, 8 color swatches, step-sliders for width+opacity, Layers button |
| `src/components/canvas/LayerPanel.tsx` | Bottom sheet (spring animation), visibility, blend mode, opacity, ↑↓ reorder, delete |

Files modified in Phase 5:
- `app/editor/[recipeId].tsx` — mode tabs (Stickers / Draw), SkiaCanvas integration, LayerPanel, `initDrawing`, undo routing by mode
- `src/components/canvas/CanvasElement.tsx` — `disabled` prop + gesture stability overhaul (see below)

**CanvasElement gesture stability fix (Phase 4 bug, fixed in Phase 5 session):**
Pinch/rotate gestures were silently broken on device.
Root cause: `useMemo` deps contained arrow function props → recreated mid-gesture when `scrollEnabled` changed → gesture reset.
Fix: all callbacks stored in `useRef`, wrapped in `useCallback(fn, [])` stable wrappers, all gesture `useMemo` have `[]` deps.
Also added explicit single-finger handles: rotation (↻, top-center drag) and scale (□, bottom-right drag) — far more reliable on small targets than two-finger pinch.

**Dev build is set up:**
- Xcode 16.3 installed at `/Applications/Xcode.app`
- `xcode-select` configured: `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
- iOS Simulator runs via `npx expo run:ios`
- `@shopify/react-native-skia` and `perfect-freehand` need to be installed before first build:
  ```bash
  npx expo install @shopify/react-native-skia
  npm install perfect-freehand
  npx expo run:ios
  ```

### What is blocked

**Phase 5 is code-complete but untested.**

Blocker: sign-in fails in the iOS Simulator. When the user taps the sign-in button, an error is shown (exact message unknown — screenshot taken but not transcribed). The error prevents reaching any authenticated screen, so Phase 5 drawing features cannot be reached or verified.

Secondary symptom: "Network request failed" errors appear in Metro logs for Supabase API calls. The Supabase project is confirmed alive. Root cause may be Simulator network sandbox restrictions, or a sign-in configuration issue.

**What to do next (for next Claude instance):**
1. Investigate and fix the sign-in error in the Simulator (check `src/api/auth.ts`, Supabase URL/anon key in `.env`, Expo dev client network settings)
2. Once sign-in works: run Phase 5 verification checklist (listed in the snappy-percolating-hellman plan file at `~/.claude-personal/plans/snappy-percolating-hellman.md`)
3. If all 11 verification steps pass → mark Phase 5 ✅ Done in this file
4. Commit all Phase 5 files + editor changes

### Files to verify exist before testing

```
src/types/drawing.ts
src/lib/drawingStore.ts
src/components/canvas/SkiaCanvas.tsx
src/components/canvas/DrawingLayer.tsx
src/components/canvas/DrawingStroke.tsx
src/components/canvas/DrawingToolbar.tsx
src/components/canvas/LayerPanel.tsx
```

## North-star test

> Before marking the project launch-ready, run this exact flow and time it.
> It must complete in under 20 minutes and the result must be something
> you are proud to give as a gift.

1. Sign up with a new account
2. Send 3 recipe links to the Telegram bot
3. Wait for recipes to appear in app
4. Tap "Make me Sketch" on each recipe
5. Open Book Builder → add cover + dedication page
6. Write a 2-line dedication with Apple Pencil (or mouse on web)
7. Pick a palette theme
8. Export full book PDF (Scrapbook style)
9. Place a print order (Lulu xPress, A5 softcover)

If the result looks beautiful and the flow feels natural: ship it.
If any step causes friction or the output looks cheap: fix before shipping.

---

## What is NOT in v1 (do not build)

- Android — build after iOS + Web validated
- Family / co-editing shared cookbooks
- Template marketplace (designers sell templates)
- User-submitted sticker packs + moderation pipeline
- Social sharing / public cookbook discovery
- Safari share extension (Telegram bot covers import in v1)
- Multiple languages in the bot (English only in v1)
- Subscription billing (validate pricing model first)
- Offline-first sync (Supabase Realtime + cache is sufficient for v1)

---

## Open questions

| # | Question | Status | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Business model** — free / freemium / paid upfront? | ✅ Decided | **Freemium.** Free tier has limits (3 cookbooks, 30 recipes, 5 AI uses/month, watermarked PDF). Premium ~$5–8/mo or ~$40/yr unlocks unlimited everything. RevenueCat handles IAP + web. Full tier table in the Monetization section above. |
| 2 | **Family sharing** — co-editing a cookbook? | ⬜ Deferred | Defer to v2. Adds real-time conflict resolution (CRDTs). Private cookbooks only in v1. |
| 3 | **Offline editing** — canvas on a plane? | ⬜ Deferred | MMKV cache + Supabase Realtime is sufficient for v1. Full offline (SQLite + sync) is a separate architecture track. |
| 4 | **Platform rollout** — iOS + Web day 1, or iOS first? | ⬜ Open | Expo supports both. Recommendation: ship iOS + Web simultaneously (same build). Android after validation. |
